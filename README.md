# PyDL = Python Description Language

PyDL is an expansion of capability to the flat graph supported by [SST](https://github.com/sstsimulator)'s Python Drive files. 

The underlying data structure is a "hypernode graph"; see <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hypernode>; 
not to be confused with <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph>.
For a mathematical thesis on the topic, see [Hypernode graphs for learning from binary relations between sets of objects](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01246240/document) by Thomas Ricatte.
Alternatively, "nested graphs" is used in [A Nested-Graph Model for the Representation and Manipulation of Complex Objects](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~mark/download/tois.pdf) by Poulovassilis and Mark Levene.
