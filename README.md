# AHPGraph - Python Attributed Hierarchical Port Graph
AHP Graphs - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06492.pdf

[Structural Simulation Toolkit](https://sst-simulator.org/) (SST) is a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) framework written in C++ and Python. 

AHPGraph is an expansion of capability to the flat graph supported by [SST](https://github.com/sstsimulator)'s Python Drive files. 

The underlying data structure is a "hypernode graph"; see <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hypernode>; 
not to be confused with <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph>.
For a mathematical thesis on the topic, see [Hypernode graphs for learning from binary relations between sets of objects](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01246240/document) by Thomas Ricatte.
Alternatively, "nested graphs" is used in [A Nested-Graph Model for the Representation and Manipulation of Complex Objects](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~mark/download/tois.pdf) by Poulovassilis and Mark Levene.



This demonstration of AHPGraph relies only on [SST-Core](https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-core)
